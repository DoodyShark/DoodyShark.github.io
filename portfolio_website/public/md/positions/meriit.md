[**Medical Robotics and Interactive Intelligent Technologies (MERIIT) Lab**](https://wp.nyu.edu/meriit/)

*Funded by the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR).*

• Co-first authored a research paper submitted for review.

• Reviewed & Extracted around 20 papers to co-author a proposal, identifying agonist-antagonist coactivation as an untapped source of redundancy for electrode dropping in sEMG-based hand gesture recognition tasks.

• Experimented iteratively on the High Performance Computing Cluster with evolving architectures & XAI tools.

• Achieved SOTA performance (90% accuracy) after reducing both architecture size & data requirements by 50%.
